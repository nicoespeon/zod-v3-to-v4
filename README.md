This is a [codemod](https://martinfowler.com/articles/codemods-api-refactoring.html) (a tool that automatically transforms code) for migrating from [Zod](https://zod.dev/) v3 to v4.

The migration guide can be found at <https://zod.dev/v4/changelog>

## Using this codemod

> This assumes you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

The first step for you is to upgrade your Zod version to v4. In doubt, check your `package.json`.

Then, you can use this codemod to automatically migrate your code from Zod v3 to v4 syntax.

### Interactive CLI

You can run it with the following command:

```bash
npx zod-v3-to-v4
```

It will ask you for the path to your `tsconfig.json` file, and then it will go through all your files and migrate Zod v3 code to v4.

### Non-interactive CLI

Alternatively, you can pass the path to your `tsconfig.json` file as an argument:

```bash
npx zod-v3-to-v4 path/to/your/tsconfig.json
```

This is useful if you ever need to run the codemod in script (e.g. in a CI pipeline).

### Installing it as a package

You can also install it as a package and run it from your project:

```bash
npm install -ED zod-v3-to-v4
```

And then run it with:

```bash
npx zod-v3-to-v4
```

### Reporting issues

If the codemod missed something or did something wrong, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nicoespeon/zod-v3-to-v4/issues).

## Contributing

This project uses [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). To get started, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

To run the tests, run:

```bash
pnpm test
```

We use [ts-morph](https://ts-morph.com) to parse and transform the code.

### Playground

If you want to test the codemod from CLI, you can use the `playground` folder. It contains a `tsconfig.json` file and some sample TypeScript files with Zod v3 code. You can run the codemod on these files with:

```bash
pnpm playground
```

Or interactively:

```bash
pnpm playground:interactive
# Then enter: playground/tsconfig.json
```
